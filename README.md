# ðŸª„Laravel Magic Installer v1.0.0

## Description : 
To install your own "copy & paste" laravel project easily and automatically configure window host file and XAMPP Apache Virtual Host file . So you can build your laravel file and quickly view it like *_**mywebsite.local**_*. 

## Weird Note ðŸ‘½
Actually I thought the project name should be Laravel On The Go. Then when in the middle of developement. I suddenly change my mind and use Laravel Magic Installer name. But since the project already half way I don't want to rewrite whole project name just for that.

## Note
The laravel project included are laravel version 9.19 and also included .htaccess and server.php which is very useful **for me** ðŸ˜‚ and convenient without accessing url through */public* folder. 

But since you are using this program. You can access all url with no problem .

    -> http://localhost/yourwebsite/your_route
    -> http://localhost/yourwebsite/public/your_route
    -> http://yourwebsite.local/your_route
    
 
## Command Flags :

    -h,--help                           -get command help
    -ip,--install-path [install_path]   -change project installation path
    -eh,--edit-host                     -edit both host file and Apache VHost together
    -i,--install [project_name]         -install new laravel project
        --hostname [hostname]           -add hostname into windows host file.
        --apache-vhost                  -add hostname to XAMPP Apache VHost file config automatically.
         --test                          -(use dummy source file to test all the command line flow.
                                         Warning* (vhost for project domain will not working properly)

Recommended Usage :

    laramin --install project_name --hostname project_name.local --apache-vhost

For Lazy Load the project domain name :

    laramin --install project_name --hostname .local --apache-vhost

To edit both windos host file and xampp vhost file :

    laramin -eh
    laramin --edit-host
This will open `notepad.exe` with windows host file and xampp vhost file.

## Requirement
Some command need elevated prompt ( *_**Run as Admin**_* ) such as :

    -eh, --edit-host, --hostname, and --apache-vhost

## Customization
You can create your own laravel configuration that might make your next copy and pasting project faster.then just zip your project and put it inside the */resource* folder as safeinstall.zip
